# Project: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Task

Use data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas. Start with this messy data set [Shark Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1). Import it, use your data wrangling skills to clean it up, prepare it to be analyzed, and then export it as a clean CSV data file.

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* The dataset that we provide you is a significantly messy data set. Apply the different cleaning and manipulation techniques you have learned.
* Import the data using Pandas.
* Examine the data for potential issues.
* Use cleaning and manipulation methods on the data.
* Produce a Jupyter Notebook that shows the steps you took and the code you used to clean and transform your data set.
* Export a clean CSV version of your data using Pandas.

## Necessary Deliverables

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
