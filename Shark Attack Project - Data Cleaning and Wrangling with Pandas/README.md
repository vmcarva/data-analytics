# Project: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Task

Use data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas. Start with this messy data set [Shark Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1). You will need to import it, use your data wrangling skills to clean it up, prepare it to be analyzed, and then export it as a clean CSV data file.

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* The dataset that we provide you is a significantly messy data set. Apply the different cleaning and manipulation techniques you have learned.
* Import the data using Pandas.
* Examine the data for potential issues.
* Use cleaning and manipulation methods on the data.
* Produce a Jupyter Notebook that shows the steps you took and the code you used to clean and transform your data set.
* Export a clean CSV version of your data using Pandas.

## Necessary Deliverables

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.

## How to Get Started

* **Examine the data and try to understand what the fields mean** before diving into data cleaning and manipulation methods.
* **Break the project down into different steps** - use the topics covered in the lessons to form a check list, add anything else you can think of that may be wrong with your data set, and then work through the check list.
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of Python, data structures, Pandas, and data wrangling.
* **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often**, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.
